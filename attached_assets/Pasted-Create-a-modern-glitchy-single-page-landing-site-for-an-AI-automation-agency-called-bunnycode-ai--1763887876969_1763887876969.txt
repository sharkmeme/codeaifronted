Create a modern, glitchy, single‑page landing site for an AI automation agency called “bunnycode.ai”. The design should visually resemble the attached o.xyz hero: minimal, high‑contrast, futuristic, and mostly one full‑screen hero section with subtle noise and scanline effects.

GENERAL STYLE

Overall vibe: sci‑fi, cyberpunk, but clean and minimal.

Background: very light gray/white with faint vertical lines, noise, and super subtle texture.

Color palette: black, dark gray, white, with small accents of neon blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow (used mainly in glitch / chromatic‑aberration effects).

Typography: bold, geometric sans‑serif for headings; simple sans‑serif for body text. Wide tracking (letter spacing) on main title.

Use lots of white space and centered alignment.

LAYOUT

Full viewport hero (100vh).

Top navigation bar:

Very thin, minimal bar, fixed at top.

Left: small text logo “bunnycode.ai”.

Center: links “SERVICES”, “SHOWCASE”, “ABOUT”, “CONTACT”.

Right: small pill button “GET AUTOMATED”.

Center hero content:

Huge text across the width: “BUNNYCODE.AI” in all caps, spanning almost the whole screen, similar scale to the o.xyz wordmark.

Apply a glitch / chromatic‑aberration effect to this text (RGB split, a few offset shadows, slight horizontal distortion).

Behind the text, show a large, faint circular shape with matrix‑style binary digits or code inside it, low opacity.

Under the main title: short tagline like “AI‑NATIVE AUTOMATIONS FOR TEAMS THAT MOVE FAST.” in smaller uppercase text.

Bottom area of hero:

Centered row of grayscale client/partner logo placeholders. Use simple rectangular or abstract logos with text labels (e.g. “CLIENT 1”, “CLIENT 2”, etc.), not real brand assets.

A tiny caption above this row: “TRUSTED BY TEAMS WORLDWIDE”.

SECTIONS BELOW HERO (simple and minimal)
Directly under the hero, create 3 slim sections on a light background, still in the same visual style:

“What We Automate”

Three columns/cards describing services like “Sales & Lead Workflows”, “Internal Ops & Reporting”, “Content & Outreach Systems”.

Each card: subtle border, hover lift, tiny glitch line animation on hover.

“How It Works”

A horizontal 3‑step timeline: “01 / Audit”, “02 / Build”, “03 / Optimize”.

Thin lines, small numbered labels, and short descriptions.

“Get Started”

Centered CTA block with heading: “Ship your first automation with bunnycode.ai”.

Short sentence and a solid button “BOOK A CALL” plus a ghost button “VIEW SHOWCASE”.

VISUAL EFFECTS & ANIMATION

Add a gentle animated noise/scanline overlay across the hero (CSS only if possible).

Subtle vertical line dividers in the background to mimic a screen.

Slow, minimal glitch animation on the main “BUNNYCODE.AI” text: tiny horizontal shifts, clipped sections, or random small distortions every few seconds.

Hover states:

Nav links: slight letter‑spacing increase and faint color accent.

Primary buttons: small scale‑up and glow shadow.

FOOTER

Very minimal footer, same background as page.

Left: “© bunnycode.ai”.

Right: small inline links “Privacy”, “Contact”.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Use plain HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript for the glitch/noise animations. No heavy frameworks.

Fully responsive: hero text and layout must scale gracefully from large desktop down to mobile. On mobile, stack navigation and reduce the wordmark size but keep the glitch style.

Code should be clean and well‑structured with classes that match the design intent (e.g. .hero, .glitch-title, .noise-overlay, .logo-row, .section-services).

Make the final result look like a custom, premium landing page for a serious AI automation agency, with the hero visually inspired by the o.xyz screenshot but not copying it exactly.
