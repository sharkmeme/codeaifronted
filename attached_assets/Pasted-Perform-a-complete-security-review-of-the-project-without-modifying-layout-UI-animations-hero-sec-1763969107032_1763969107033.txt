Perform a complete security review of the project without modifying layout, UI, animations, hero section spacing, or BunnyOrb behavior.

Apply ONLY the following security improvements:

1. Environment Variables & Secrets
   - Scan the entire codebase for any API keys, Supabase keys, SMTP credentials, tokens, or private keys inside client-side code.
   - If any secrets are exposed in the React client, move them to server/.env and import them via the server only.
   - Ensure .env is listed in .gitignore.
   - Confirm no secrets are bundled into the Vite build.

2. CORS & API Hardening
   - In server/index-prod.ts or server/app.ts:
     - Restrict CORS to only allow:
       https://bunnycode.ai
       http://localhost:3000
     - Block all other origins.
   - Ensure API endpoints do not accept unsafe or unvalidated input.
   - Sanitize any user-supplied data before sending to Supabase or email services.

3. Security Headers
   Add these headers globally to server responses (Express or equivalent):
     - X-Frame-Options: DENY
     - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
     - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
     - Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
     - Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS (max-age=63072000)

4. Rate Limiting
   - Add a simple rate limiter to contact form endpoints (e.g., max 5 requests per minute per IP).
   - Prevent automated spam or abuse of Supabase email sending.

5. Input Validation
   - Validate and sanitize:
     - Contact form fields (name, email, message)
     - Any user input sent to logs, email, or database
   - Prevent injection or malformed payloads.

6. Remove Sensitive Info From Error Messages
   - Ensure no server error responses leak stack traces or secrets.
   - Replace with generic "An error occurred" messages in production.

7. Disable Debugging in Production
   - Remove console.log, console.error, console.warn from production builds.
   - Ensure Vite config disables sourcemaps:
       build: { sourcemap: false }

8. File Safety
   - Ensure /public files are served as static assets only.
   - Confirm no uploaded file execution is possible.

9. robots.txt (for search engines)
   - Leave as-is unless changed manually. No action needed for security.

10. Output a full report:
   - List all vulnerabilities found.
   - List what was fixed automatically.
   - List what requires manual review.
   - Confirm that no visual UI was modified.

Do NOT modify:
- Hero layout
- BunnyOrb positioning or transforms
- Any spacing or margins
- Any animations
- Any components unrelated to security
