I want you to fully finalize my entire website into a complete, professional, premium AI agency website. 

Follow ALL of these steps EXACTLY and thoroughly:

========================================
1) AUDIT THE ENTIRE PROJECT
========================================
Review the full codebase under client/src and identify:
- unused components
- placeholder text like “Client 1, Client 2…”
- incomplete sections (Services, Showcase, About, Contact)
- missing images
- dead links
- navbar items that don’t scroll correctly
- inconsistent spacing or typography
- components that need branding

Do NOT delete anything yet. Just audit so you know what to fix.

========================================
2) UPDATE ALL COPYWRITING (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================================
Write premium, concise, modern agency-level copy for all sections:

HERO SECTION:
- Headline: “AI-Native Automation That Moves Fast.”
- Subheadline: “We build fully automated systems, AI content engines, and next-generation workflows for creators and businesses.”
- CTA 1: “Get Automated”
- CTA 2: “View Services”

SERVICES SECTION:
Create 4 service cards:
1. Process Automation  
2. Content Automation  
3. Trading Automation  
4. AI Website Development

Each service card needs:
- Title
- 2–3 sentence professional description

SHOWCASE SECTION:
Create 6 high-quality placeholder showcase tiles:
- “Automation Dashboard”
- “AI Content Engine”
- “Trading Bot Framework”
- “AI Website Builder”
- “Short-Form Automation”
- “Lead-Gen Funnels”

Each with a short subtitle.

ABOUT SECTION:
Create premium about copy:
- who Bunnycode/Bunnyhoney is
- why we build AI systems
- unique selling points

CONTACT SECTION:
Link directly to /get-automated

========================================
3) FIX NAVBAR AND SCROLL ROUTING
========================================
Make all navbar items anchor-scroll to their sections:

- Services → scroll to #services
- Showcase → scroll to #showcase
- About → scroll to #about
- Contact → scroll to #contact
- Get Automated → route to /get-automated

Implement smooth scrolling.

========================================
4) ADD REAL SECTION IDS
========================================
Add the following to the respective containers:
id="services"
id="showcase"
id="about"
id="contact"

========================================
5) REPLACE ALL PLACEHOLDER TEXT
========================================
Remove:
- “Client 1, Client 2…”
- placeholder images
- placeholder text blocks

Replace client list with actual dummy brands:
- “Trusted by forward-thinking creators and businesses.”

Add 5 placeholder client logos (use neutral monochrome SVGs located in public folder).

========================================
6) ADD VISUAL STRUCTURE & STYLING
========================================
Apply consistent:
- spacing (padding sections 96px top/bottom)
- typography hierarchy
- Tailwind classes
- layout max-w-7xl centered grids
- responsive breakpoints

Ensure the site looks visually cohesive.

========================================
7) FIX ALL BUTTONS
========================================
Ensure:
- top navbar links work
- “GET AUTOMATED” button routes correctly
- “View Services” scrolls to #services

========================================
8) FOOTER
========================================
Add a clean footer:
- Bunnyhoney.ai © 2025
- “AI-Native Automation”
- Links to: Services / Showcase / About / Contact / Get Automated

========================================
9) DO NOT TOUCH BACKEND OR DATABASE
========================================

========================================
10) APPLY ALL CHANGES
========================================
Refactor all necessary files under:
- client/src/pages/App.tsx
- client/src/routes/Home.tsx (if exists)
- client/src/components
- client/src/sections (create if needed)

Keep everything consistent and style-safe.

========================================
11) REPORT BACK
========================================
After completion, output:
- List of all updated files
- Summary of changes
- Any remaining TODOs (if needed)
